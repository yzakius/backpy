# Backpy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yzakius/backpy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yzakius/backpy)

*A simple backup tool written in python.*

Backpy is just a exercise result of my python learning.

Currently I'm studying "os" module and my purpose is to write a simple script using rsync to sync my laptop hd with a external hd.
