# Backpy

![Build Status](https://github.com/yzakius/backpy/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

*A simple backup tool written in python.*

Backpy is just a exercise result of my python learning.

Currently I'm studying "os" module and my purpose is to write a simple script using rsync to sync my laptop hd with a external hd.
